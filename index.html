    <div class="poem-line">Named for a process: <span id="shards_015" class="annotation">molten glass dripped into water will shatter</span>.</div>
    <div class="poem-line">Something about the molecular <span id="shards_026" class="annotation">s</span>tructures. Something about <span id="shards_030" class="annotation">w</span>atching one become a <span id="shards_023" class="annotation">thousand.</span> </div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-stanza">
    <div class="poem-line"><span id="shards_021" class="annotation">M</span>y father describes the process one afternoon at the old studio, across the lot </div>
    <div class="poem-line">from where a ballet company stores their giant wooden Nutcrackers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-stanza">
    <div class="poem-line"><span id="shards_017" class="annotation">I</span>n the studio, he knows where to find each color, his <span id="shards_018" class="annotation">j</span>ars lined up and packed with shards </div>
    <div class="poem-line">to fill in the concave plaster molds. He tries to teach me how to arrange the colors, shapes.</div>
    <div class="poem-line">Wants to share what life is his. </div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-stanza text-right">
    <div class="poem-line">I <span id="shards_027" class="annotation">t</span>hink that’s what you’re supposed to do with family.</div>

    <div class="poem-line"><span id="shards_014" class="annotation">after washing out a pot of burned rice,</span></div>
    <div class="poem-line"><span id="shards_011" class="annotation">rain gutters crammed with leaves.</span></div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-stanza">
    <div class="poem-line">First it was sloping clay on the potter’s wheel. Now designing, molding, baking, mounting </div>
    <div class="poem-line">slabs of <span id="shards_022" class="annotation">glass</span> on walls, pedestals, iron skeletons. It’s why he dropped out of college, or so he tells me. </div>
    <div class="poem-line">Or <span id="shards_016" class="annotation">h</span>e told himself. Or someone told him </div>

    <div class="poem-line">he wasn’t good enough at anything else. </div>
    <div class="poem-line"><span id="shards_006" class="annotation">His father used to buzzcut his hair</span> </div>
    <div class="poem-line">every summer. Practicality was all. </div>
    <div class="poem-line">As soon as he moved out, my father grew </div>
    <div class="poem-line">his hair into a long, red ponytail. </div>
    <div class="poem-line">He lived in the studio, plaster under his nails,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">checked the kilns in the middle of the night, learned how to create</div>
    </div>

    <div class="poem-stanza">
    <div class="poem-line">a fusing of shapes into something, if not durable,</div>
    <div class="poem-line">able to imagine <span id="shards_028" class="annotation">solidity</span>. A shaking of shards into the spirals and diamonds </div>
    <div class="poem-line">and <span id="shards_012" class="annotation">d</span>eckled edges of the mold, sun-tipped eyes settling down, holding each other as heat flares.</div>

    <div class="poem-stanza">
    <div class="poem-line"><span id="shards_025" class="annotation">I cup my hands and he fills the bowl</span> with <span id="shards_029" class="annotation">azure and wheat</span>, <span id="shards_032" class="annotation">violet and umber</span>.</div>
